### **About Me**

I'm an _Epidemiology student_ and a _Chronic Disease Researcher_ with a medical background. I am currently doing my Masters in Public Health in Epidemiology at _Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health_ . My expected date of graduation is in May, 2021. I am a Doctor from India and graduated from medical school in March 2019. 
I am passionate about working at the forefront of chronic disease prevention in areas such as cancer, neurological and cardiovascular diseases.
